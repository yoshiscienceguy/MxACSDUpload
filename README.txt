Please put folders using this stucture:
File Structure for both folder and file:
/home/pi

The only folders that are there now are : Desktop, MxPiDrive, python_games
The only file that there is: mxUpload

Open a console and type in: sh mxUpload

if you have internet it will run sucessfully

if not the error will tell you that you don't

make sure the school's internet allows connection to Google Drive. Pretty sure they do.

It's highly recommended that you don't edit any of the python files, because half of the coding I did it and it's just going to be chaos if you do. But if you want to tiker around with it, you are more than welcome.

The structure that the school's drive should be is for example:

Ponderosa -> [Teacher's Name] -> [Team Name] -> [Code]/[Document]

The program is designed to make teams relativley easy. For example, if I am trying to make a team called "Team Red".

I launch the program by typing sh mxUpload, select the school, click on "(Create New Team"), type new team name. Give a few seconds, it's creating the team folder and adding the technical report template. The list should update automatically. Select the team, then click "choose" button. Then you will see 2 folders, Code and Document. Choose whichever of those 2 folders and click upload. Look for the file on the popup window and click it, then click Open. Once clicked the file will be uploaded and the text will change to "Upload 'filename' sucessfull" Then you are done!

Any feedback is appreciated.
